# scie-pants

The scie-pants binary is intended to be the next-generation `./pants` script.

It's currently in a phase of development suitable for trying out in any existing Pants-using
project. We welcome early adopters who want to try it out and report successes, failures and where
things work but could be better.

## Installing

For now, you'll need to download the correct binary for your system, mark it as executable and place
it on your $PATH somewhere.

The binaries are released via [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/pantsbuild/scie-pants/releases)
for both Linux and macOS and both aarch64 and x86_64 chip architectures. Pants itself does not
support Linux aarch64 quite yet, but `scie-pants` is ready for it!

I run on Linux x86_64; so I install a stable release like so:
```
curl -fLO \
  https://github.com/pantsbuild/scie-pants/releases/download/v0.1.9/scie-pants-linux-x86_64
curl -fL \
  https://github.com/pantsbuild/scie-pants/releases/download/v0.1.9/scie-pants-linux-x86_64.sha256 \
  | sha256sum -c -
chmod +x scie-pants-linux-x86_64 && mv scie-pants-linux-x86_64 ~/bin/scie-pants
```

You can then run `scie-pants` anywhere you'd use `./pants` and other places besides. It should work
just like your existing `./pants` script but with ~33% less latency launching Pants.

If you'd like to build you own version, see the [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md). There are
build instructions there.

## Features

Beyond support for all known existing `./pants` script features, the `scie-pants` executable
provides the following:

+ A hermetic Python interpreter appropriate for the current active Pants version:

  You no longer need to have Python of the right version, or even any Python at all, installed on
  your system to use Pants. If you use `scie-pants` in a repo with old Pants (< 2.5.0), it will
  fetch a CPython 3.8 interpreter to use and a CPython 3.9 interpreter otherwise. These interpreters
  are self-contained from the [Python Build Standalone](
  https://python-build-standalone.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) project.

+ The ability to run Pants in a subdirectory of your project:

  This is of limited utility since Pants internals don't support this well at the moment, but as
  soon as they do, `scie-pants` will allow you to work in the style you prefer.

+ Built-in ability to set up a new Pants project:

  If you run `scie-pants` in a directory where Pants is not already set up, it will prompt you, and
  you can let it set up the latest Pants stable version for your project.

## Caveats

The `scie-pants` binary will re-install versions of Pants you have already installed. The underlying
[`scie`](https://github.com/a-scie/jump/blob/main/README.md) technology uses an `nce` cache
directory that is different from the `~/.cache/pants/setup` directory used by the `./pants` script.
This is a one-time event per Pants version.

Naming the `scie-pants` binary `pants` will lead to an obscure error currently in a repo with an
existing `./pants`. That is tracked [here](https://github.com/pantsbuild/scie-pants/issues/28).

The `scie-pants` does not work in the Pants repo itself. That repo has a special `./pants` script
and declares no `pants_version`. As such, if you run `scie-pants` in the Pants repo, you'll be
prompted to set up the latest stable version of Pants. You can just answer no and remember not to
use `scie-pants` in the Pants repo.

## Solving Problems

### Try upgrading

If you run into an issue with `scie-pants` you might 1st try upgrading. You can do this with:
```
SCIE_BOOT=update scie-pants
```

That will update to the latest available stable release if there is a newer one and tell you if
there is not. You can also supply a `scie-pants` version as the sole argument to downgrade or switch
to a specific version.

### Report an issue

You can report an issue directly at https://github.com/pantsbuild/scie-pants/issues. Please include
the `scie-pants` version you're using. You can get this by running:
```
PANTS_BOOTSTRAP_VERSION=report scie-pants
```

You might want to check the existing issues first though. There are some known features and bugs on
the roadmap you may have run into and if there is an existing issue, you can chime in on your
support for it or your particular take on it.

### Chip in

There is a [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) and more developer docs are coming soon. Any help
fixing bugs or improving UX is very welcome.
