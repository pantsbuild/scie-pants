The `scie-pants` binary is intended to be the next generation Pants launcher.

Like the current `./pants` bash  script launcher, it determines the required Pants version for the
current Pants-using project and launches it, installing that Pants version if needed.

Unlike the current `./pants` bash script, the `scie-pants` binary:
+ Provides a guaranteed CPython 3.8+ interpreter appropriate to the Pants version being installed.
+ Is intended for use globally as a binary installed on the `PATH`.

When invoked, the `scie-pants` binary searches from the `CWD` of its invocation up through ancestor
directories to find the `pants.toml` signalling a Pants-using project. It then parses `pants.toml`
to discover the Pants version required and launches that Pants version. Since the `scie-pants`
launcher is a native binary, this process is very fast, typically ~one millisecond, in the hot path
where the needed Pants version is already installed.

The slow path, where a new Pants version needs to be installed or Pants bootstrap utility functions
are invoked, is not performance sensitive and can benefit from the Python 3.8+ interpreter the
`scie-pants` launcher guarantees. As such, the Pants installer, bootstrap tools and more are written
in Python 3 and embedded in the `scie-pants` scie as a single `tools.pex` [conscript busy-box](
https://pypi.org/project/conscript/) with multiple console script entry points. This allows for the
core logic of the slow path to be complex but manageable with type-checking, unit testing and all
the power Python generally provides.

Any help pushing forward the `scie-pants` launcher and its supporting Python tools is very welcome.
Thank you in advance for your time and effort.

## Development Environment

You'll need just a few tools to hack on scie-pants:
+ If you're new to Rust you'll need to ensure you have its toolchain available to you. You might
  start with [`rustup`](https://rustup.rs/).
+ Currently, bootstrapping builds [ptex](https://github.com/a-scie/ptex) to use in fetching
  additional build dependencies. Although `ptex` is a Rust project as well, it requires [CMake](
  https://cmake.org/) for one of its sys crates. CMake is generally available via your operating
  system's package manager or Homebrew, for example, if you're on Mac.
+ The [`scie-jump`](https://github.com/a-scie/jump) launcher plays a critical role in the structure
  and operation of `scie-pants`. Although the [package](package/src/main.rs) build process takes
  care of obtaining the `scie-jump` binary itself, you should familiarize yourself with its
  [packaging format](https://github.com/a-scie/jump/blob/main/docs/packaging.md), which both the
  [build process itself](package/pbt.lift.json) and the final [`scie-pants` binary](
  package/scie-pants.lift.json) use.

## Development Cycle

You might want to open a [discussion](https://github.com/pantsbuild/scie-pants/discussions) or
[issue](https://github.com/pantsbuild/scie-pants/issues) to vet your idea first. It can often save
overall effort and lead to a better end result.

The code is run through the ~standard `cargo` gamut. Before sending off changes you should have:
+ Formatted the code (requires Rust nightly): `cargo +nightly fmt --all`
+ Linted the code: `cargo clippy --all`
+ Tested the code: `cargo test --all`

Additionally, you can run any existing integration tests with `cargo run -p package -- test`. This
packages the `scie-pants` scie and then uses it to launch Pants which formats, lints, checks, tests
and re-packages the scie-pants [tools](tools) Python support code.

You can also just package the `scie-pants` scie binary via `cargo run -p package -- scie`. That will
build the `scie-pants` binary for the current machine to the `dist/` directory by default (run
`cargo run -p package -- --help` to find out more options). Two files will be produced there:
1. The `scie-pants` binary: `scie-pants-<os>-<arch>(.<ext>)`
2. The `scie-pants` fingerprint file: `scie-pants-<os>-<arch>(.<ext>).sha256`

You can then run `dist/scie-pants-<os>-<arch>(.<ext>) <pants goals>` to run Pants against the tools
code when iterating on it.

## Guiding Principles

There are just a few guiding principles to keep in mind as alluded to above:
+ The `scie-pants` hot path should be fast: It currently launches Pants in ~one millisecond and that
  should hold steady.
+ The `scie-pants` binary should be relatively small: It's currently ~8MB on Linux x86_64 (the
  largest binary). It would be nice to not grow much larger than 10MB.
+ The `scie-pants` binary should be extremely stable: It's intended that there is only ever a single
  main line of development from which releases are cut and the built-in self-update capability is
  used to upgrade with.
